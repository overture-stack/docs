Overture is a genomics data platform that combines front and back-end services. Stage handles navigation, while Arranger enables data search. Authentication runs through Keycloak/Ego, Song manages metadata, Score handles S3 file transfers, and Maestro indexes to Elasticsearch for Arranger's search functionality. Together, these components enable efficient genomics data management.
