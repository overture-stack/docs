# Conductor 

Conductor is a flexible Docker Compose setup that simplifies the process of spinning up Overture development and deployment configurations using Docker profiles and extensible scripting events.

## Key Features

- **Profile-based Deployments**: Uses Docker profiles to manage different environment setups.
- **Conductor-driven Execution**: The Conductor service executes ordered scripts based on the `PROFILE` environment variable.

## System Architectures

The following diagrams illustrate the system architecture for each deployment:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="platform" label="Platform" default>
  ![Platform](./images/platform.svg 'Overture Platform')
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="songDev" label="SongDev">
     ![Song Dev](./images/songDev.svg 'Song Dev Environment')
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="scoreDev" label="ScoreDev">
     ![Score Dev](./images/scoreDev.svg 'Score Dev Environment')
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="maestroDev" label="MaestroDev">
     ![Maestro Dev](./images/maestroDev.svg 'Maestro Dev Environment')
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="arrangerDev" label="ArrangerDev">
     ![Arranger Dev](./images/arrangerDev.svg 'Arranger Dev Environment')
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="stageDev" label="StageDev">
    ![Stage Dev](./images/stageDev.svg 'Stage Dev Environment')
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

All components are automatically deployed and configured, with exception to the services highlighted in pink. These services in the deployment context require manual setup and configuration for local development, instructions are provided within the logs following deployment.

## Getting Started

**1. Clone the repo branch**

```
git clone https://github.com/overture-stack/conductor.git && cd conductor
```

**2. Run one of the following commands to spin up different environments:**

| Environment | Unix/macOS | Windows |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| Overture Platform | `make platform` | `make.bat platform` |
| Stage Dev | `make stageDev` | `make.bat stageDev` |
| Arranger Dev | `make arrangerDev` | `make.bat arrangerDev` |
| Maestro Dev | `make maestroDev` | `make.bat maestroDev` |
| Song Dev | `make songDev` | `make.bat songDev` |
| Score Dev | `make scoreDev` | `make.bat scoreDev` |

Each command spins up complementary services for the specified development environment.

- **`conductorScripts/`** Contains scripts for orchestrating the deployment process.
    - `deployments/`: Scripts that execute service scripts sequentially based on the deployment configuration. These also include custom post-deployment logs with essential next steps for the deployment scenario.
    - `services/`: Modular scripts for individual service setup tasks. Each file is named according to its purpose, with inline comments documenting the code.

- **`configurationFiles/`** Stores all required configuration files, including:
    - `arrangerConfigs/`: Configuration files specific to Arranger.
    - `elasticsearchConfigs/`: Configuration files for Elasticsearch, encompassing indexing mappings and documents for seeding data.
    - `keycloakConfigs/`: Configuration files for Keycloak, including preconfigured realm files and Overture API key provider details.

- **`guideMaterials/`** Supplementary folders and files for use with the [Overture guides](https://www.overture.bio/documentation/guides/).

- **`persistentStorage/`** Directory for storing persistent data during container startups and restarts. These folders come pre-loaded with mock data.
    - `data-keycloak-db/`: Persistent local storage for the Keycloak database.
    - `data-minio/`: Persistent local storage for MinIO object storage.
    - `data-song-db/`: Persistent local storage for the Song database.

- **`Makefile`** Contains make commands for Unix-based systems (macOS, Linux) to streamline Docker operations.

- **`make.bat`** Windows equivalent of the Makefile, featuring batch commands tailored for Windows systems.
