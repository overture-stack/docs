  :::caution
  **Note:** Ensure enough resources get allocated to Docker. We recommend a minimum CPU limit of `8`, memory limit of `8 GB`, swap of `2 GB`, and virtual disk limit of `64 GB`. You can access these settings by selecting the **cog wheel** found on the top right of the Docker desktop app and selecting **resources** from the left panel. **If you already have docker desktop installed, ensure you are on version 4.39.0 or higher**.
