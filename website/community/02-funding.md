# Funding

We gratefully acknowledge the financial support that has made this project possible. Our work has been funded by the following organizations and grants:

### Canadian Institutes of Health Research

As working group 2, we are developing a federated framework for genomic data access and analysis, specifically building an enhanced Overture data submission system to facilitate the ingestion, validation, and tracking of clinical and molecular data into the PCGL platform.

  - **Project Title:** Pan-Canadian Genome Library (PCGL)
  - **Funding Period:** 2023-2028

### National Cancer Institute at the US National Institutes of Health

Under this grant we are making the Overture platform more accessible by breaking down barriers to adoption, integrating existing analysis tools and adding federated search functionality between distributed Overture instances using standardized data governance frameworks ([GA4GH](https://www.ga4gh.org/)).

  - **Grant Number:** #U24CA253529
  - **Funding Period:** 2021-2026

### Canadian COVID-19 Genomic Data Infrastructure 

The [VirusSeq Data Portal](https://virusseq-dataportal.ca/) demonstrates Overture's successful expansion beyond oncology data management. This funding facilitated the platform's adaptation to support viral genomic data, while enabling the development, deployment, and ongoing maintenance of Canada's central SARS-CoV-2 sequence repository.

  - **Project Title:** VirusSeq Data Portal
  - **Funding Period:** 2020-2024

### The Government of Ontario

The Overture platform is developed and maintained by the Genome Informatics Software Engineering group at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research (OICR). Our team is partly supported through operational funding from the Government of Ontario via OICR. OICR receives core funding from the Government of Ontario through the Ministry of Colleges and Universities.
